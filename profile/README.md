## Understanding the Tax Regimes: Old vs New

Before diving into the calculator, let’s first understand the core differences between the old and new tax regimes.

### Old Tax Regime:
In the old tax regime, taxpayers can avail of various exemptions and deductions, such as:
- **HRA (House Rent Allowance)**
- **80C deductions (PPF, LIC premiums, EPF, etc.)**
- **80D deductions (Health insurance premiums)**
- **Interest on home loan**
- **Standard deduction of ₹50,000 for salaried individuals**

This regime allows taxpayers to optimize their tax payments by claiming exemptions and deductions, which can significantly lower their taxable income.

### New Tax Regime:
The new tax regime, introduced in 2020, offers reduced tax rates but eliminates most of the exemptions and deductions available under the old regime. The tax slabs under the new regime are as follows:
- **₹2.5 lakh – ₹5 lakh**: 5%
- **₹5 lakh – ₹10 lakh**: 20%
- **Above ₹10 lakh**: 30%

Though the new regime seems appealing due to the lower tax rates, it may not always work out to be beneficial for everyone. This is where the **Old vs New Tax Regime Calculator Excel** comes in handy to calculate which regime would save you more money.
